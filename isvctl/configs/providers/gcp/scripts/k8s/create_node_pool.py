"""Create / scale a GKE test node pool via Terraform (GCP analog of the EKS
oracle's create_node_pool.sh).

One script serves three suite steps because `terraform apply` is idempotent:
  * create_test_node_pool      (CPU pool, node_type=cpu)
  * create_test_gpu_node_pool  (GPU pool, node_type=gpu -> guest_accelerator)
  * update_test_node_pool      (re-apply the SAME CPU pool with a higher count)

The pool's local tfstate filename is DERIVED from its RUN_ID-scoped pool name, so
create / scale / destroy of one pool all thread the SAME state without an extra
env var (update re-applies in place; destroy re-derives the same file). Cluster
wiring (name, location) is read from the primary cluster's state via
terraform_remote_state.

Before ANY pool lookup, refresh, import, or apply, the parent cluster is proven to
carry THIS run's exact full-run-identity ownership marker (verify_cluster_ownership)
— on every path (fresh create, in-state scale, adopt) — so a stale pool state can
never create/scale/reconcile a pool inside a colliding same-name foreign cluster.

Every path ends on a POOL-SCOPED completion gate so success means the pool actually
converged, not just that Terraform/import returned:
  * GPU pool: wait for THIS pool's own nodes (its label_selector) to be Ready with
    allocatable nvidia.com/gpu, then apply and read back nvidia.com/gpu.present=true
    on exactly those nodes so the released GPU checks discover them.
  * CPU pool: require a healthy RUNNING GKE pool state and THIS pool's requested
    Ready-node count (its own label_selector) to converge — the adopt path only
    imports+refreshes (never applies), so this gate is what stops an unready
    RECONCILING/ERROR adopted CPU pool from reporting success.
A timeout, unhealthy pool state, labeling error, missing node, or readback mismatch
keeps step success false.

For a GPU pool the zone is chosen by the same capacity preflight setup uses (a
GKE node-pool CREATE op cannot be cancelled, so the pool is never created in an
unprobed zone).

Emits the `node_pool` schema the suite reads via {{steps.<step>.*}}.
