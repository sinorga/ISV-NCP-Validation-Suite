    Full-run-identity ownership marker stamped on the cluster's resource_labels at

    cross-worker adopt verifies before importing the cluster, and that setup/teardown
    require to match before relabeling or destroying a state-tracked cluster — so a
    same-name cluster this run does not own is never adopted or destroyed. Stamping it
    atomically here (rather than only via a post-apply gcloud update) means a
    genuinely run-owned cluster ALWAYS carries the marker, so an absent marker
    reliably signals a foreign/replaced cluster. Empty default keeps a var-less
