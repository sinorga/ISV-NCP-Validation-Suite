# Primary GKE cluster for ISV Lab validation (the GCP analog of the AWS EKS
# realism oracle at ../../../aws/scripts/eks/terraform). Provisions a
# google_container_cluster via the official hashicorp/google provider — the
# REAL create/scale/destroy path for the cluster lifecycle, driven by
# setup.py / teardown.py through a local-backend state file threaded across the
# separate lifecycle-step processes.
#
# The cluster is created with:
#   - remove_default_node_pool + a small separately-named system (CPU) pool, so
#     no unmanaged default pool exists.
#   - a baseline GPU node pool whose zone the stub picks by capacity preflight,
#     so the in-cluster GPU checks (nvidia-smi / driver / capacity / pod-access)
#     have Ready GPU nodes before setup emits inventory.
#   - Dataplane V2 (datapath_provider = ADVANCED_DATAPATH) so Kubernetes
#     NetworkPolicy is ENFORCED natively (K8sNetworkPolicyCheck has no skip path).
#   - control-plane logging components enabled so K8sControlPlaneLogsCheck can
#     read apiserver/scheduler/controller-manager logs from Cloud Logging.
#   - managed_prometheus DISABLED: its gmp-system/collector DaemonSet does not
#     tolerate the dedicated NoSchedule taint on the CPU test pool and would sit
#     Pending, failing K8sNoPendingPodsCheck. No released k8s check consumes GMP.
