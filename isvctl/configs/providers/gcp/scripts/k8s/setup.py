"""GKE cluster setup (setup phase) — the GCP analog of the AWS EKS oracle setup.

Provisions the primary GKE cluster via Terraform (official hashicorp/google
provider), installs the kubeconfig with `gcloud container clusters
get-credentials` (ambient kubectl), gates on the GPU driver finishing (two-gate
preflight), then emits the `cluster` inventory observed live via kubectl.

Cluster shape (see terraform/main.tf):
  * remove_default_node_pool + a separately-named system (CPU) node pool.
  * a baseline GPU node pool whose zone is chosen by a capacity preflight probe
    (a standalone size-1 MIG mirroring the GPU shape — a GKE node-pool CREATE op
    cannot be cancelled, so the pool is never created in an unprobed zone).
  * Dataplane V2 so Kubernetes NetworkPolicy is enforced natively.
  * control-plane logging enabled (Cloud Logging) + managed Prometheus DISABLED.

Post-provision bootstrap before inventory:
  * apply a passthrough `nvidia` RuntimeClass (handler `runc`) so the released
    GPU-workload manifests that pin `runtimeClassName: nvidia` schedule on the
    managed-driver GPU path without installing the GPU Operator.
  * label GKE GPU nodes nvidia.com/gpu.present=true (what the released GPU checks
    select on).
  * two-gate preflight: a GPU node Ready + allocatable nvidia.com/gpu AND a
    responding nvidia-smi driver, BEFORE emitting inventory.
