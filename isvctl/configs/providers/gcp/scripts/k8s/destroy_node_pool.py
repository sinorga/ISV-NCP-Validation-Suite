"""Destroy a GKE test node pool created by create_node_pool.py (teardown phase).

Serves both destroy_test_node_pool and destroy_test_gpu_node_pool. Exact-
ownership cleanup via the threaded state file derived from the RUN_ID-scoped pool
name — never a broad label/name discovery sweep. Idempotent: an already-absent
pool (no state file) is success, not an error.

A var-less `terraform destroy` re-evaluates the whole config, so it needs a value
for every no-default variable. Target-identifying inputs (project, pool_name,
cluster_state_path) are re-derived to the SAME run-scoped values create used;
inputs the delete does not consume (machine_type) take a benign placeholder. The
cluster wiring the module reads via terraform_remote_state at create is PERSISTED
in this pool's own state (cluster_name / cluster_location outputs), read back
here, and threaded as fallback vars — so the destroy still resolves even if a
best-effort teardown already destroyed the primary before a transient retry.

Honors --skip-destroy (GCP_K8S_SKIP_TEARDOWN=true): a preservation request
short-circuits to a structured success BEFORE any auth/Terraform, so the node
pools are preserved alongside the cluster instead of being torn down while the
primary teardown is skipped.
