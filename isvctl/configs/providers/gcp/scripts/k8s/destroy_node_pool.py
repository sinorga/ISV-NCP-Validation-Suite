"""Destroy a GKE test node pool created by create_node_pool.py (teardown phase).

Serves both destroy_test_node_pool and destroy_test_gpu_node_pool. Exact-
ownership cleanup via the threaded state file derived from the RUN_ID-scoped pool
name — never a broad label/name discovery sweep. Idempotent: an already-absent
pool (no state file) is success, not an error.

A var-less `terraform destroy` re-evaluates the whole config, so it needs a value
for every no-default variable. Target-identifying inputs (project, pool_name,
cluster_state_path) are re-derived to the SAME run-scoped values create used;
inputs the delete does not consume (machine_type) take a benign placeholder. The
cluster wiring the module reads via terraform_remote_state at create is PERSISTED
in this pool's own state (cluster_name / cluster_location outputs), read back
here, and threaded as fallback vars — so the destroy still resolves even if a
best-effort teardown already destroyed the primary before a transient retry.

Honors --skip-destroy (GCP_K8S_SKIP_TEARDOWN=true): a preservation request
short-circuits to a structured success BEFORE any auth/Terraform, so the node
pools are preserved alongside the cluster instead of being torn down while the
primary teardown is skipped.

    A pool whose local state is absent or VALID-EMPTY no longer carries its own

    describe the exact pool live is recovered from the primary cluster state (the same

                           be read, OR local state is absent and no deterministic
                           parent location was supplied -> fail closed
