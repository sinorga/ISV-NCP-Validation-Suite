# Secondary GKE cluster that shares the primary cluster's VPC network (GCP
# analog of the AWS EKS oracle's terraform-shared-vpc-cluster). GKE supports
# multiple clusters in one VPC natively — the secondary simply attaches to the
# SAME network/subnetwork read from the primary cluster's state. No subnet
# tagging is required (unlike EKS). Its own local state (selected by the stub
# via -state=) so it can be destroyed independently before the primary teardown.
