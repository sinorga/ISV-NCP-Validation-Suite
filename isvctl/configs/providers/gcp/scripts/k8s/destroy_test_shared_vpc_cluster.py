"""Destroy the secondary shared-VPC GKE cluster (teardown phase).

Runs BEFORE the primary teardown so the secondary releases the shared network
first. Exact-ownership cleanup via the threaded secondary-cluster state.
Idempotent: an already-absent secondary (no state / never ran — the step is
gated by the unreleased K8sMultiClusterSameVpcCheck) is success. The location /
network / subnetwork vars are re-derived from the SECONDARY's OWN persisted state
(not the primary's) so the var-less destroy resolves even after a best-effort
teardown already destroyed the primary — no "No value for required variable" and
no dependency on the primary state's outputs surviving.

Honors --skip-destroy (GCP_K8S_SKIP_TEARDOWN=true): a preservation request
short-circuits to a structured success BEFORE any auth/Terraform, so the
secondary cluster is preserved alongside the primary.
