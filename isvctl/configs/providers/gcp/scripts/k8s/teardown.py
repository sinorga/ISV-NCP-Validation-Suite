"""Destroy the primary GKE cluster (teardown phase).

Exact-ownership destroy via the threaded cluster state (the RUN_ID-suffixed
cluster setup created); a var-less `terraform destroy` re-derives the same
required inputs from env/state so it never aborts "No value for required
variable". Idempotent: an already-gone cluster is success. Honors the
--skip-destroy flag (GCP_K8S_SKIP_TEARDOWN=true) so an operator can keep the
cluster for debugging.

Two GKE-specific teardown steps beyond the EKS oracle:
  1. Reclaim run-created PVC-backed Persistent Disks BEFORE the cluster is
     destroyed — a GKE cluster delete does NOT reclaim them, so they orphan as
     standalone Compute disks (the released NIM/CSI checks create such PVCs).
  2. `terraform init` runs UNCONDITIONALLY (never gated on `.terraform`) so a
     teardown-on-failure after setup bailed early (stale/absent lock) still
     reconciles the lock and no-ops cleanly instead of aborting "Inconsistent
     dependency lock file".
  3. BACKSTOP: after the cluster is gone, delete Compute disks in ANY zone whose
     goog-k8s-cluster-name label == THIS run's cluster (exact ownership, never a
     name-pattern sweep). A failed disk listing or a surviving disk is surfaced
     as `cleanup_errors` with `success=False` — a leaked billable disk never
     presents as a clean teardown.
  4. BACKSTOP: reclaim any GPU capacity-preflight probe MIG / instance-template
     this run left behind (setup + create_test_gpu_node_pool each probe), scoped
     to THIS run's probe-name prefix. A probe MIG is a standalone billable size-1
     GPU resource outside Terraform state and without the cluster label, so a
     failed inline probe delete would otherwise leak silently; an unconfirmed
     reclaim is surfaced as `cleanup_errors` with `success=False` too. This probe
     backstop is scoped purely to the run id (independent of any cluster state), so
     it runs on EVERY non-preservation path — including when no cluster state
     exists (a setup GPU-preflight bail can leave a probe MIG without ever writing
     cluster state) and after a failed `terraform destroy` (each backstop runs in
     its own guarded block, so a destroy raise no longer skips the reclaim).
