# Remote Deployment

Deploy ISV NCP Validation Suite to a remote machine and run validation tests.

## Overview

The `isvctl deploy run` command packages and transfers the tools to a remote target, then executes validation tests. This is useful for:

- Testing clusters you can't access directly
- Air-gapped environments (via jumphost)
- CI/CD pipelines deploying to target clusters

## Prerequisites

- SSH connectivity to `<target-ip>` (key-based auth recommended)
- A user with sufficient permissions (e.g., docker group for container tests, or sudo if required)
- Network reachability to external services (ISV Lab Service, registries) unless using a jumphost

## Environment Variables

Environment variables required by tests must be set on the local machine - they are forwarded to the remote session automatically:

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `ISV_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` | Required for result upload to ISV Lab Service |
| `ISV_SSA_ISSUER` | Required for result upload to ISV Lab Service |
| `ISV_CLIENT_ID` | Required for result upload to ISV Lab Service |
| `ISV_CLIENT_SECRET` | Required for result upload to ISV Lab Service |
| `NGC_API_KEY` | Required for NIM model benchmarks |

## Usage

### Basic Deployment

```bash
# Deploy and run tests on remote machine
uv run isvctl deploy run <target-ip> -f isvctl/configs/suites/k8s.yaml
```

### With Jumphost

For air-gapped environments, use a jumphost/bastion server:

```bash
# -j accepts <jumphost> or [user@]<jumphost> with optional :<port>
uv run isvctl deploy run <target-ip> -j <jumphost[:port]> -u ubuntu -f isvctl/configs/suites/k8s.yaml

# Example with user and custom port:
uv run isvctl deploy run 10.0.0.10 -j ubuntu@bastion.example.com:2222 -u ubuntu -f isvctl/configs/suites/k8s.yaml
```

### With Config Overrides

Later config files override earlier ones:

```bash
uv run isvctl deploy run <target-ip> -f isvctl/configs/suites/k8s.yaml -f my-overrides.yaml
```

### With Pytest Arguments

Pass extra pytest arguments after `--`:

```bash
uv run isvctl deploy run <target-ip> -f isvctl/configs/suites/slurm.yaml -- -v -s -k "test_name"
```

### With ISV Lab Service Integration

Upload results to the ISV Lab Service:

```bash
uv run isvctl deploy run <target-ip> -f isvctl/configs/suites/k8s.yaml --lab-id 35 --isv-software-version "2.1.0-rc3"
```

## Command Options

Run `uv run isvctl deploy run --help` for all available options:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `<target>` | Target machine IP or hostname |
| `-f, --config` | Config file(s) to use (can be specified multiple times) |
| `-u, --user` | SSH user on target machine |
| `-j, --jumphost` | Jumphost for air-gapped environments |
| `--lab-id` | Lab ID for result upload |
| `--isv-software-version` | ISV software version metadata |

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Slurm

For Slurm tests that use docker, ensure the remote user is in the docker group or configure privilege escalation if supported:

```bash
# If docker requires sudo on the remote host
sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" isvctl test run -f isvctl/configs/suites/slurm.yaml
```

### Kubernetes

Ensure the remote user has `kubectl` access configured (e.g., `~/.kube/config` exists and is valid).

## Troubleshooting

**Connection refused:**

- Verify SSH access: `ssh <user>@<target-ip>`
- Check firewall rules on target
- Verify jumphost connectivity if using `-j`

**Permission denied:**

- Ensure SSH key is authorized on target
- Check user has required permissions (docker group, kubectl access, etc.)

**Tests fail remotely but work locally:**

- Verify environment variables are set locally (they're forwarded automatically)
- Check network access from target to required services (registries, ISV Lab Service)
